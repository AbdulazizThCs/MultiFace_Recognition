# MultiFace_Recognition
Develop a Python‑based face recognition tool that locates, matches, and labels players’ faces from a single group photograph accurately.

# Project Idea:
A face recognition system for **Saudi Al‑Ahli football** players using Python, OpenCV, and face_recognition library.

#  Features  
1. Detects multiple faces within one frame.  
2. Matches each face against stored reference images.  
3. Draws clear, labeled bounding boxes around faces.  
4. Utilizes CNN for enhanced detection accuracy.  

# Files Included  
- `Face_Recognition.py`  
- `Test_Face.jpg`  
- `Output_Face_Recognition.jpg`

# How to Use 
1. **Setup Environment:** Install Anaconda and create a clean Python 3.10.11 environment.  
2. **Library Installation:** Add OpenCV, face_recognition, and NumPy libraries into your environment.  
3. **Prepare Data:** Organize known players’ images into separate subfolders and place your test image.  
4. **Configure Interpreter:** Open the project in **VSCode** and select the conda environment as interpreter.  
5. **Execute Script:** Run the `Face_Recognition.py` script to detect and label all faces in the test image.
